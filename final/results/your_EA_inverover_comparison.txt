The inver-over algorithm consistently outperformed the generational gap algorithm (EA3) 
across all TSP instances. Inver-over got lower average costs, very similar to the optimal solutions,
with very low standard deviations which shows it was both a better and more stable algorithm. 
On the other, hand the generational gap algorithm showed significantly higher costs and variances, 
especially on the larger instances such as pcb442 or the KROs. The inver-over algorithm achieved 
these costs more efficiently, it took about 4.5 hours to run inver-over 30 times for
each instance whereas the generational gap took closer to 7 hours.
